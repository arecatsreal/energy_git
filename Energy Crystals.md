# Energy Crystals
 
Energy crystals are crystals that can hold (ep) of there respective energies.

## Electric Stimulation 
If a energy crystal can be electrically stimulated it can be put into a device witch can be used by a mundane. Due to
the crystal releasing its power when a electric current is passed thou it. Some energy crystals can be stimulated by an
user of another energy.

## Purity Levels 

Purity Levels along with crystal size effect the strength of an crystal along with its price.

## Crystal Size 

All crystals come in Small, Medium, and Large sizes there are both smaller an larger sizes of crystals, but they are
rare, and normally quite unstable. The Size determines the amount of (ep) a crystal can hold, but not its (ep) input and
output rates.

### Size (ep)/rate Table 

| Color    | Energy Type   | Formula (ep) Storage    | (ep) in/out rate   |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Black    | Life          | (H * 200) + (W * 200)   | 10(ep)/s           |
| Yellow   | Kinetic       | (H * 200) + (W * 200)   | 10(ep)/s           |
| Pink     | Mind          | (H * 1) + (W * 1)       | 0.5(ep)/s          |
| Green    | Time          | (H * 5) + (W * 5)       | 3(ep)/s            |
| Blue     | Matter        | (H * 200) + (W * 200)   | 10(er)/s           |

#### Table Key
H = Hight in cm & W (Width) = H/4.
