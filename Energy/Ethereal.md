Warp energy is similar to ethereal energy in a multitude of ways. Namely the ability to create
portals but these portals one, have no size constraints, but object will go thru the back of the
portal and hit what ever is in front. Two theses portals can not be placed with in 0.25 AU of the
user.

When using their portals they have a focused and unfocused range. The focused rage requiring a focuser(that is too big
to fit on a ship), but having a much grater rage then the unfocused.
