# Basic Energy Rules

All energy requires the user to channel it to be, used. Most energies require both arms to be free
for the elbow down.

## Energy points (ep)

Some energies require (ep) to use (there are: Life, Kinetic, Time, Matter). Energy points are;
stored, named, measured and, regained differently for each energy. The energies that don't use (ep)
simply manipulate the already excising energy in the world.

## Energy Devices and Crystals

Energy is a form of power, and it obeys the [first law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics) energy crystals are
natural deposits of energy most act as batteries as such they can be discharged and then
recharged (only can be recharged by a user of the same energy as the crystal). These crystals can be
used to power different devices that then can do actions similar to use energy but at a much lower
efficiency.

Recharging and discharging only apply to crystals of (ep) energies.

## Sub Energies

Some energies have different variations theses variations could more or less rare than the base
energy. 

## Energy Leveling

Most energies have levels. Leveling up is determined by either the GM or the xp system.

## Mundane
A mundane is someone without energy.

|--------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purple | [[Ethereal]]  | Allows the user to either create portals a short distance away or either retrieve or deposed an item into the Either.                                |
| Black  | [[Life]]      | Gives the user the ability to both drain and restore life from a willing/broken living object.                                                       |
| Yellow | [[Kinetic]]   | Turns the users caloric energy into kinetic energy witch can be, directed towards any singe point (no smaller than 3cm in radios) in sight (max:1k). |
| Red    | [[Thermal]]   | Allows the user to control already existent thermal energy.                                                                                          |
| White  | [[Fusing]]    | Grants the user the ability to combine and control the energy of willing/unconscious channeled energy users or energy in is liquid state.            |
| Pink   | [[Mind]]      | Can see and manipulate for a (ep) cost the Mind-web.                                                                                                 |
| Green  | [[Time]]      | Gives the user the ability to glide theme selves and any items on there person thru time for a cost of (ep).                                         |
| Orange | [[Ohoou]]     | The Ohoou is a energy based hive mind although individuals or groups of individuals my be separated form the central hive mind.                      |
| Blue   | [[Matter]]    | The user has the ability to change the state of matter at will.                                                                                      |

## [[Energy Crystals]]
Energy crystals are crystals that can hold (ep) of their respective energies.
